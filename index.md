# New in the HollyWood industry ? Here's how to make it to the top !

You just get your first background character role, and you're wondering how you should play your move to become HollyWood's most famous actor or actress ? Then you stumbled on the right website: in the following sections, we'll show you how to organize your carreer, who to play with, in what kind of film to starr in, and other tricks to boost your popularity to the top !

## don't starr in documentary movies
Who thought that to be famous you have to play in films that people _actually_ want to watch ? And no, I'm not saying you should be a porn actor. Even though that could work out.

    <div class="mb2">
        <select id="s_year" onchange="update_current_hist()"></select>
        <select id="s_genre" onchange="update_current_hist()"></select>
    </div>

## Don't play with famous actors
If you starr in a film with Leonardo di caprio, you won't ever be famous. It's like filming a porno with Rocco Sifredi. Everyone will remember him, no one will remember you. Instead, try playing with kind and talentful actors like Ben Stiller.

## Wanna tune your carreer even further ?
Here's a beautiful list of what will probably impact your career. If you're a smartass, you'll notice that talent is not on the list. That's because of 2 reasons : 
    1. you don't have any
    2. we don't have an efficient way of measuring that

# You're in the top 10 most famous actors in America, well done. But here are a few tips to stay on top.

## don't stop making films
Yeah dumbass, if the public stops seeing you on the big screen, you won't be famous anymore. Stupid.

## be the main character in the films you starr in
Or don't, I don't care. But don't come back crying because nobody nominated you for the oscars.
