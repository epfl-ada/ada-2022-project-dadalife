# New in the Hollywood industry? Here's how to make it to the top!

You just got your first background character role, and you’re wondering how you should play your move to become 
HollyWood’s most famous actor or actress? Then you stumbled on the right website: in the following sections, we’ll 
show you how to organize your career, who to play with, what kind of film to star in, and other tricks to boost your 
popularity to the top!

# Fame definition

Throughout these tips supported by analysis, we had to make some choices, one of them (and not the least) being the
definition of fame. When can we say that you are a Hollywood star? While the philosophical answer to this question is
out of the scope of this analysis, we find a numerical way to describe it. The website The Numbers provides a yearly 
ranking of 300 to 500 actors and actresses according to their fame. Fame is defined as “having starred in a high 
Domestic Box Office movie”.

This metric makes sense as it answers the following question: “How many people saw you, how much money did this movie
produce?”. We can consider it as the part of fame produced by the films, exluding all the other aspects like social
media, magazines, etc.

HERE IS A GRAPH THAT SHOWS OUR SCORE COMPARED TO GOOGLE TRENDS, SO IT'S KINDA OF A GOOD SCORE.
