# Road to being a star !

This branch contains the code to run GitHub Pages for the 2022 ADA project of the dADAlife group.
It is built using [jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) with [Yet Another Theme](https://github.com/jeffreytse/jekyll-theme-yat).

The page is publicly accessible from [here](https://epfl-ada.github.io/ada-2022-project-dadalife/).

If you want to run it locally :
```bash
git clone git@github...
cd ada-2022-project-dadalife
bundle install
bundle exec jekyll serve
```
