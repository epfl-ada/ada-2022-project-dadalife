# Road to being a Hollywood star!

This repo contains the CS-401's project of the dADAlife group. The project aims to closely look at actor's carreers, and find out success factors and roles. The data story linked to this project can be accessed [here](https://epfl-ada.github.io/ada-2022-project-dadalife/). 
This project is supervised by Lars Klein.

## Abstract
What impacts the career of an actor or actress? When one must make decisions about their career, popularity might be something to look for. Knowing what maximises one's chances to become more popular or what minimises it is a useful information to have. This project aims to find how specific patterns impact actors and actresses in their career. 

## Project questions
- Will co-acting with a famous actor pushe you into the light, or will you be shadowed by the big name ?
- Is it important to star in big-budget films, or can small-budget films also boost one's career? 
- Is quality more important than quantity? I.e. does staring in one big movie has a bigger impact than staring in several "little" movies ?
- When do we see peaks of popularity in actor·ress? Is the peak linked to a particular event?
- What patterns can we highlight before an actor·ress becomes popular?
- What are the statistical evidences that support our findings?

This project shall answer the preceding questions in a visual manner, making it both easy and satisfying to read the results.

- ```raw_data``` is composed from the imported datasets described below, CMU Movie Summary Corpus and The Numbers. 
- ```preprocessed_data``` is composed of data after being handled by ```preprocessing.ipynb```, e.g. cleaning the data, filtering and thoughtfully dropping some entries.
- ```preprocessing.ipynb``` takes raw data as input and outputs preprocessed data, suitable for analysis.
- ```career_booster.ipynb``` looks closely at actors called career boosters, aka actors that starred in many movie that revelated other actors.
- ```coacting_features.ipynb``` computes a logistic regression over movies that revelated some actors to output weights on which features are important.
- ```insight_coacting_impact.ipynb``` generates graphs to give insights on the impact of coacting.

To see the code and information about our data story, you will find everything you need to know in the branch ```pages```.

## Datasets
### CMU Movie Summary Corpus
The initial and teaching staff supported dataset for this project is the [CMU movie summary corpus](http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~ark/personas/). It describes films, as well as actor participation in said films, with about 42'000 films and 450'000 acting entries.

### The Numbers
As the CMU Movie Corpus doesn't provide a sufficient basis to compute an actor's or a film's popularity, we will also use [The Numbers](https://www.the-numbers.com/box-office-star-records/domestic/yearly-acting/). It is publicly available as long as wanted data is copied by hand and not automatically scraped. As the data is in a quite dense format, this doesn't represent much work. The dataset provides a "star scores" for many actors, from 1980 to 2022. Each year contains between 300 and 600 **american** actors data, and the "star score" is what we'll use for actors popularity.

### Google Trends
We used [Google Trends](https://trends.google.com) as an evaluation to check whether our computed popularity metric made sense. We compared our computed scores with Google Trends entries and were satisfied with the results.

## Methods & steps
### Data sanitization
While extracting global features of the dataset, we stumbled upon a few incoherences in the data. Those went to actors being not yet born on the date they starred in a movie, to movie length being smaller than 5 seconds, or bigger than 10 hours. We decided to correct some mentioned errors using the last Freebase dump, and we dropped the ones that were too hard to correct.

### Dataset global analysis
To analyse and better define the next step's pipeline, we first globally analysed the dataset we had. The analysis, along with some conclusion drawn from it, can be found in the jupyter notebook.

### Definition of the popularity
The last step was to find an appropriate popularity measure for each actor. We first tried to use the numbers of mentions of an actor in films critics using the [Rotten Tomatoes](https://www.rottentomatoes.com/) dataset, but it was a far too noisy estimate. This is where *The Numbers* comes into play. It calculates the popularity according to the box office revenue, but smoothens it across time. 

### Choice of an interesting subset
The *CMU Movies Summary Corpus* contains more than 50% of USA movies. This is probably due to the dataset being made by an american university. In parallel to this, we chose to use a popularity metric based on the box office revenue. As we don't exactly know how this is compared across countries in our dataset, this metric is only relevant across one country (or would need to be standardized, with respect to the GDB for example). Furthermore, *The Numbers* has many different dataset including a specific one (whuch we used) scoring the actors popularity based on the the US BO revenue.
