## Abstract
What impacts an actor career ? This project aims to find how specific pattern impact actors and actresses in their career. Does co-acting with someone famous throw you into the light, or are you shadowed by the already famous actors ? Is it important to starr in big-budget films, or do small-budget films have a similar impact ? Is quality more important than quantity? 

This project shall answer the preceding questions in a visual manner, making it both easy and satisfying to read the results.

## Datasets
### CMU Movie Summary Corpus
The initial and teaching staff supported, dataset this project is based on is the [CMU movie summary corpus](http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~ark/personas/). It describes films, as well as actor participation in said films, with about 42'000 films and 450'000 acting entries.

### The Numbers
As the CMU Movie Corpus doesn't provide a sufficient basis to compute an actor's or a film's popularity, we will also use [The Numbers](https://www.the-numbers.com/box-office-star-records/domestic/yearly-acting/). It's publicly available as long as wanted data is copied by hand and not automatically scraped. As the data is in a quite dense format, this doesn't represent much work. The dataset provides a "star scores" for many actors, from 1980 to 2022. Each year contains between 300 and 600 **american** actors data, and the "star score" is what we'll use for actors popularity.

### Google Trends
We also consider using [Google Trends](https://trends.google.com) as it is an efficient way to have a "popularity" estimation with a finer granularity.
